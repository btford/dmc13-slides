## Abstract

AngularJS is a powerful client-side JavaScript library for building web apps. Many developers are finding that AngularJS greatly simplifies and improves their development process. Using PhoneGap together with Angular, you can have this same power and simplicity in a mobile app. Better yet, you can write code that's portable across desktops, phones, and tablets.

This talk will cover the basics of working with AngularJS, as well as some special considerations when working with PhoneGap. The talk will also cover how to debug, test, and benchmark AngularJS apps with Phonegap, which are extremely important for building robust apps.


## Running it

Launch webserver, visit `index.html`.
Here's a simple example using a python web server:

```shell
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
```

Then visit [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).
